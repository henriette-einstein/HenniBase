## Research: History of Industrialization
_Researched on 2026-02-26_

### Overview

The research covers the full arc of industrialization from its origins in 18th-century Britain through the global spread of industrial capitalism into the early 20th century. Sources provide strong coverage of the British origins, the technological innovations of the First Industrial Revolution (c. 1760–1840), the social and demographic consequences of industrial urbanization, the Second Industrial Revolution (c. 1870–1914) with particular focus on Germany and the United States, and German industrialization within the imperial period. Key figures such as James Watt, Richard Arkwright, and George Stephenson are well documented. The social question, labor conditions, and the emergence of the welfare state are also covered. Gaps remain regarding industrialization outside Europe and North America, and the environmental history of the industrial era.

### Potential Subtopics for Further Research

- [[First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840)]] – The foundational phase (c. 1760–1840) centered on textiles, steam power, and Britain deserves its own event note.
- [[Second Industrial Revolution (1870-1914)]] – Steel, electricity, chemicals, and mass production (c. 1870–1914) warrant a separate event note covering Germany and the United States.
- [[James Watt]] – Central figure in steam engine development and the broader technological transformation of the era.
- [[Richard Arkwright]] – Pioneer of the factory system and water-frame spinning. His Cromford Mill is the prototype of industrial production.
