The Social Question (German: Soziale Frage) refers to the set of political, economic, and moral debates in the 19th century concerning the living and working conditions of the industrial working class and the means by which society should respond to them. The term became central to European political discourse from the 1840s onward, as accelerating industrialization concentrated large numbers of wage laborers in urban manufacturing centers, separating them from agricultural subsistence and exposing them to poverty, disease, and labor instability.

The conditions prompting the Social Question were documented in contemporary investigations and polemical works: Frederick Engels's *The Condition of the Working Class in England* (1845) described the slum housing, child labor, and epidemic mortality of [[Manchester]]'s industrial districts. Parliamentary reports in Britain on factory conditions and mining led to early regulatory measures, including the Factory Acts of 1833 and 1844 and the Mines Act of 1842, which restricted child labor and established minimum standards.

In Germany, the Social Question intensified during the Durchbruchphase of industrialization from the 1850s onward, as rural migrants flooded into industrial centers in the [[Ruhr Valley]], Saxony, and the Rhineland. The political response took two main forms. From below, workers organized in trade unions and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), founded in 1875, which interpreted the Social Question through a Marxist framework demanding the abolition of capitalist property relations. From above, the imperial government under Otto von Bismarck responded with a combination of repression (the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878) and pioneering social legislation: health insurance (1883), accident insurance (1884), and old-age and disability insurance (1889). This Bismarckian welfare state was the first systematic attempt by a modern industrial state to mitigate the risks of industrial labor through compulsory public insurance, and it became a model for social policy across Europe in the 20th century.

The Social Question did not disappear with the introduction of welfare legislation. Labor conflicts, strikes, and political polarization continued to shape European politics until and after World War I. The competing answers to the Social Question, reform versus revolution, defined the ideological fault lines of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
