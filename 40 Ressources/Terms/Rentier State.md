A rentier state is a state that derives all or a substantial share of its national revenues from rents paid by foreign actors for access to indigenous natural resources, most commonly hydrocarbons. The concept was introduced by the Iranian economist [[Hossein Mahdavy]] in 1970 in his analysis of oil revenues in Iran, and was elaborated into a broader political theory by [[Hazem Beblawi]] and [[Giacomo Luciani]] in their 1987 volume *The Rentier State*.

The word derives from the French *rentier*, denoting a person who lives on income from property or investments rather than from labour. In political economy, "rent" designates income accruing from the ownership of an asset without productive contribution. Applied to states, the term captures the structural condition in which a government receives large external revenues without needing to tax its own population.

[[Beblawi]] identified four defining characteristics: rent situations predominate in the economy, the rent originates externally, only a small fraction of the population participates in generating it, and the state is the principal recipient and distributor. [[Luciani]] added the distinction between *allocation states*, which spend externally derived rent, and *production states*, which extract revenue primarily from domestic taxation.

The central political argument of rentier state theory is that the absence of taxation severs the link between citizens and government accountability. Where governments distribute rather than extract, populations have reduced incentive to organise political demands, facilitating [[Authoritarianism]] and impeding [[Democratisation]]. Beblawi termed the resulting disposition the [[Rentier Mentality]]. The theory has been applied primarily to oil-producing states in the [[Gulf States|Persian Gulf]] and broader [[Middle East and North Africa|MENA region]], including [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], as well as resource-dependent states in Africa and Latin America.

Related concepts include the [[Resource Curse]], which captures the broader set of developmental pathologies associated with natural resource dependence, and [[Dutch Disease]], which describes the macroeconomic distortions produced when resource revenues crowd out other productive sectors.

### Theorists
- [[Hossein Mahdavy]] – Introduced the term in 1970 in his study of oil revenues in Iran
- [[Hazem Beblawi]] – Co-developed rentier state theory and defined the concept of rentier mentality
- [[Giacomo Luciani]] – Contributed the allocation/production state distinction in the 1987 volume

### Related Concepts
- [[Resource Curse]] – The broader thesis that natural resource wealth impedes economic and political development
- [[Dutch Disease]] – The macroeconomic mechanism by which resource revenues crowd out other economic sectors
- [[Rentier Mentality]] – The disposition of citizens in a rentier state toward passive receipt of state distributions

- [[Democratisation]] – The process rentier state theory argues is impeded by the absence of taxation

### Examples and Context
- [[Saudi Arabia]] – The most-cited example of a rentier state, dependent on hydrocarbon revenues since the mid-20th century

- [[OPEC]] – The organisation of major oil-exporting states, many of which are analysed as rentier states
- [[Gulf States]] – The primary geographic context in which rentier state theory was developed
- [[MOC Cold War]] – The Cold War created the geopolitical conditions under which Gulf oil states developed their rentier structures
