The steam engine is a heat engine that converts the thermal energy of steam, generated by heating water, into mechanical work. It is considered the defining technological symbol of the [[First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840)]] and, in its improved forms, a foundational power source for the [[Second Industrial Revolution (1870-1914)]].

The first practical steam engine for industrial use was Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine of 1712, designed to pump water from flooded mine shafts. Newcomen's engine operated on a principle of alternating steam condensation and atmospheric pressure, making it functional but highly inefficient: it lost most of its thermal energy in the repeated cooling and reheating of the cylinder.

The transformative improvement came from [[James Watt]], who was commissioned to repair a Newcomen model at Glasgow University in 1763. Watt identified the thermal inefficiency and in 1769 patented a design incorporating a separate condenser, allowing the main cylinder to remain hot throughout the cycle. This dramatically increased efficiency and reduced coal consumption. In collaboration with the manufacturer Matthew Boulton, Watt subsequently developed a rotary steam engine capable of driving machinery, rather than merely pumping water. This rotary motion, introduced in the 1780s, made steam power applicable across the full range of industrial processes: textile mills, iron works, flour mills, paper mills, distilleries, and eventually railways and steamships.

The role of the steam engine in initiating industrialization is frequently overstated in popular accounts. Economic historians note that in the early decades of the First Industrial Revolution, water power remained the primary energy source in textile mills, and the steam engine's contribution to overall industrial output was initially modest. Its significance grew substantially in the 1820s and 1830s, and became decisive with the application to railway locomotion. The steam locomotive, developed by [[George Stephenson]] and others, was the most visible and culturally significant application of steam technology, enabling the rapid construction of national railway networks across Britain, continental Europe, and North America from the 1830s onward.

The steam engine was progressively superseded by the internal combustion engine and by electric motors from the late 19th century onward, though it remained important in heavy industry and shipping well into the 20th century.
