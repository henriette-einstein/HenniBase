The factory system is the mode of industrial organization in which production is concentrated in large, purpose-built facilities employing wage laborers who work with machinery owned by capitalist proprietors. It replaced the domestic system and the putting-out system, under which production had been dispersed across artisan workshops and private households.

The factory system emerged in Britain during the [[First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840)]], with [[Richard Arkwright]]'s Cromford Mill (1771) conventionally cited as its prototype. The organizing principles of the factory system are centralization of machinery and labor, standardized working hours and labor discipline, division of tasks, and separation of the workplace from the home. These principles were dictated in part by the technical requirements of water-powered and later steam-powered machinery: the machines were too large and expensive to be located in individual homes, and they required coordinated operation by multiple workers.

The factory system entailed profound changes in the nature of labor. Workers were separated from ownership of their tools and means of production, becoming dependent on wages. Working hours were long, typically twelve to sixteen hours per day in the early 19th century. Labor was repetitive and subject to the pace of machinery rather than the rhythms of agricultural seasons or artisan craft. Child labor was widespread in the earliest factories, with children as young as eight employed in textile mills and mines. Factory work also posed serious physical hazards: textile mills were kept damp and poorly ventilated to protect cotton threads, exposing workers to respiratory disease, while machinery caused frequent injuries.

The social consequences of the factory system were among the central subjects of 19th-century political economy and social criticism. Karl Marx's analysis of alienated labor and the capital-labor relation was grounded in observation of the factory system. Friedrich Engels's *The Condition of the Working Class in England* (1845) documented living and working conditions in [[Manchester]]'s industrial districts. In Germany, the expansion of the factory system from the 1830s onward generated the [[Social Question]], the political question of how to address the poverty and instability of the industrial working class, which Bismarck's welfare legislation of the 1880s sought to answer through state paternalism.

The factory system ultimately produced, alongside its social costs, dramatic increases in productivity and output, and created the material conditions for the sustained economic growth of the 19th and 20th centuries.
