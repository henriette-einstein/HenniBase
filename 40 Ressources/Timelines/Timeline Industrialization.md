## Key Phases and Events of Industrialization

**c. 1712** — Thomas Newcomen develops the first practical steam-powered pump, used to drain mine shafts in England.

**c. 1760** — Beginning of the First Industrial Revolution in Britain. Textile production shifts from cottage industry to mechanized mills.

**1764** — James Hargreaves invents the spinning jenny, multiplying thread output per worker.

**1769** — [[Richard Arkwright]] patents the water frame, enabling machine-spun cotton thread. [[James Watt]] patents his improved steam engine with a separate condenser.

**1771** — [[Richard Arkwright|Arkwright]] opens Cromford Mill in Derbyshire, the world's first water-powered cotton mill. It employs around 200 workers in two 12-hour shifts.

**1779** — Samuel Crompton develops the spinning mule, combining features of the jenny and water frame.

**1785** — Edmund Cartwright patents the power loom, mechanizing weaving.

**1788** — [[James Watt|Watt]] introduces the centrifugal governor for automatic speed control of steam engines.

**1807** — Prussian Reforms under Stein and Hardenberg, including Bauernbefreiung and Gewerbefreiheit, lay the institutional groundwork for German industrialization.

**1814** — [[George Stephenson]] builds his first steam locomotive, Blucher, for hauling coal.

**c. 1820–1840** — Steam power spreads across British industries: flour, paper, cotton, iron, distilling. Railways begin to connect major cities.

**1825** — Stockton and Darlington Railway opens, the first public railway in the world to use steam locomotives.

**1830** — Liverpool and Manchester Railway opens, the first intercity passenger railway. End of the First Industrial Revolution's core phase in Britain.

**1830–1850** — Frühindustrialisierung in Germany. First German railway runs between Nuremberg and Fürth (1835). Textile industry and iron processing expand in Saxony and the Rhineland.

**1834** — Founding of the Deutscher Zollverein, creating a unified economic area among German states.

**1848** — Revolutions across Europe. Industrial workers and craftsmen displaced by machinery participate in urban unrest.

**1850–1873** — Durchbruchphase (breakthrough phase) of German industrialization. Railway network expands rapidly. Ruhr coal and steel production grows. Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, and Dresdner Bank founded during Gründerzeit.

**1851** — UK census reveals more people living in towns than in the countryside for the first time in history.

**1856** — Henry Bessemer patents the Bessemer process for mass-producing steel from pig iron.

**c. 1870** — Beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution. Steel, electricity, and chemistry replace textiles and iron as leading sectors. Germany and the United States emerge as major industrial powers.

**1871** — German unification. The new Reich enters a phase of Hochindustrialisierung. Industrial output begins its sixfold expansion to 1914.

**1873** — Gründerkrach: stock market crash ends the speculative boom of the Gründerzeit. Prolonged depression follows.

**1879** — Bismarck introduces Schutzzölle (protective tariffs) to shield German agriculture and industry from foreign competition.

**1881** — First electric tram line opens in Berlin, operated by Siemens.

**1883–1889** — Bismarck's Sozialgesetzgebung: health insurance (1883), accident insurance (1884), old-age and disability insurance (1889). The first modern welfare state legislation.

**c. 1885–1914** — Ausbauphase (expansion phase): electrical industry, machine-building, and chemical industry become Germany's leading export sectors. BASF, Bayer, and Hoechst control approximately 90% of world dyestuff production by 1913.

**c. 1900** — United States surpasses both Germany and Britain in steel production.

**1903** — Wright Brothers' first powered flight signals emerging second-order technological revolution.

**1914** — Outbreak of World War I ends the era of uninterrupted industrial expansion. Germany holds approximately 15% of world industrial output, Britain 14%, the United States 32%.
