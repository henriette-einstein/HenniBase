NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is a military and political alliance founded on 4 April 1949 through the North Atlantic Treaty. Its political headquarters is located in Brussels (Belgium), while the military command structure, SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe), is based in Mons (Belgium). As of 2024, the alliance comprises 32 member states from North America and Europe.

## Founding and Origins

The North Atlantic Treaty emerged in the immediate aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]] against the backdrop of growing tensions between the western democracies and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Soviet blockade of Berlin (1948/49), the communist coup in Czechoslovakia (1948), and the first Soviet atomic weapons test (1949) demonstrated that a collective security arrangement was necessary to institutionalise the American military presence in Europe. Twelve states signed the treaty on 4 April 1949 in Washington: the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Portugal]], and [[Italy]].

The core of the alliance is Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which defines an armed attack against one member state as an attack against all members and obliges each member to render assistance. The article has been invoked once in the alliance's history, following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States.

## Expansion and Development

Membership grew in several stages. Greece and Turkey joined in 1952, and West Germany in 1955. The accession of West Germany prompted the Soviet Union to establish the [[Warsaw Pact]] as a counter-alliance within days. Spain followed in 1982.

France withdrew from the integrated military command structure in 1966 under Charles de Gaulle without formally leaving the alliance, and returned to the command structure in 2009 under Nicolas Sarkozy.

After the end of the [[Cold War]] and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, NATO underwent a contested eastward expansion. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic joined in 1999, followed by seven further states in 2004, among them the Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which had previously been part of the Soviet Union. Further accessions followed in subsequent decades. Finland joined in 2023 and Sweden in 2024, after both countries abandoned their longstanding policies of military neutrality.

## Operations

The alliance conducted its first combat operation in 1999 in Kosovo, launching airstrikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia without a UN mandate in order to compel the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo. From 2003 NATO assumed command of the ISAF mission in [[Afghanistan]], which concluded in 2014. A follow-on mission, Resolute Support, ended with the full withdrawal in 2021.

Russia's invasion of [[Ukraine]] in February 2022 triggered the most extensive reactivation of the alliance since the end of the Cold War. NATO reinforced its eastern flank, raised the readiness of standing forces, and coordinated the supply of equipment and training to Ukraine by member states, without itself becoming a party to the conflict. The invasion also substantially accelerated the accession processes of Finland and Sweden.

## Structure

Political decision-making takes place in the North Atlantic Council, in which all member states are represented and decisions are reached by consensus. The Secretary General holds the highest civilian office of the alliance. The Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) is, by a convention established in 1951, always a United States military officer.
