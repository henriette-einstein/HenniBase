The Abadan Oil Refinery is an oil refinery located on Abadan Island in the province of [[Khuzestan]], southwestern [[Iran]], at the confluence of the Arvand Rud (Shatt al-Arab) and the Bahmanshir rivers, approximately 53 kilometres north of the [[Persian Gulf]]. The site was selected by the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] in 1909 for its proximity to the oil fields of [[Khuzestan]], its river access for tanker shipping, and the availability of cooling water. Construction began in 1910 and refining operations commenced in 1912 at an initial capacity of 2,500 barrels per day. It was the first large-scale oil refinery in the Middle East.

## Industrial Development

The refinery expanded rapidly under [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Anglo-Persian]] and later [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] management through the 1920s and 1930s, drawing a workforce from across Iran and from British India, and generating a company town on the island with segregated residential quarters for British staff and Iranian workers. By the 1940s the refinery had become central to Allied war logistics: during the [[Second World War]] it supplied aviation fuel to Allied air forces at volumes of up to 25,000 barrels per day, and capacity expansion during this period made it the largest single oil refinery in the world, a distinction it held into the 1970s. At its peak in 1980 the refinery processed approximately 635,000 barrels per day and was paired with a substantial petrochemical complex.

The company town of Abadan grew in parallel, reaching a population of over 220,000 by the mid-1950s, its economy almost entirely dependent on the refinery. The physical organisation of the town, with its British-built club, hospital, and residential compounds, made the foreign presence materially visible in a way that became a focal point for Iranian nationalist grievance.

## The Nationalisation Crisis

The refinery was the epicentre of the [[Iranian Oil Nationalisation Crisis (1951-1953)]]. On 1 May 1951 Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] nationalised the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], and the Iranian government took formal possession of the refinery. Britain responded by withdrawing its technical staff and organising an international boycott of Iranian oil exports. By October 1951 the last British employees had departed, and the refinery operated at sharply reduced capacity through Iranian engineers and managers.

The standoff lasted until August 1953, when a joint [[CIA]] and [[MI6]] operation known as [[Operation Ajax (1953)]] overthrew Mosaddegh and restored [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]]. The following year a new consortium of international oil companies, in which [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company|British Petroleum]] retained a 40 percent share alongside American, French, and Dutch partners, assumed control of Iranian oil production and refining under a profit-sharing arrangement. The refinery returned to near-full operation under this framework.

The Abadan crisis is treated in [[Barr - Lords of the Desert]] as a pivotal episode in the Anglo-American competition for the Middle East: Britain sought to restore its dominant position in Iranian oil, while the United States prioritised Cold War concerns about Iranian political stability over the defence of British commercial interests, ultimately backing the coup only after concluding that Mosaddegh's position had become untenable from a strategic standpoint.

## The Iran–Iraq War

In September 1980 [[Iraq]] invaded [[Khuzestan]] in the opening phase of the [[Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988)]]. Abadan was besieged for eleven months and subjected to artillery and aerial bombardment. The refinery, operating at 628,000 barrels per day at the time of the invasion, was extensively damaged and reduced to approximately 10 percent of capacity. Despite the siege the city was never captured. Reconstruction began after the 1988 ceasefire and the refinery resumed limited operation in 1993, reaching pre-war production levels by 1997. As of 2013 its certified capacity stood at approximately 429,000 barrels per day. In 2017 the Chinese company [[Sinopec]] signed a contract for a further expansion valued at approximately one billion US dollars.
