The Ruhr Valley (German: Ruhrgebiet or Ruhrrevier) is an industrial region in western Germany, centered on the Ruhr River and located in what is now the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It became the core of German heavy industrialization and, for much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the largest industrial agglomeration in continental Europe.

The region's industrial development was founded on its exceptional endowment of high-quality bituminous coal, which lay in accessible seams across the northern Ruhr basin. Coal mining expanded from the mid-18th century, but the decisive transformation came with the construction of the railway network from the 1840s onward, which connected the Ruhr coalfields to iron ore deposits in the Rhineland, to the port of Duisburg on the Rhine, and to markets across Germany and beyond. The fusion of coal mining with iron and steel production created an integrated industrial complex of extraordinary scale.

During the Durchbruchphase of German industrialization, part of the [[Second Industrial Revolution (1870-1914)]], (c. 1850–1873), the Ruhr became the dominant producing region for pig iron, steel rails, and heavy machinery. The open-hearth steelmaking process was adopted in the Ruhr from 1869, enabling a shift from the Bessemer process and allowing the use of phosphoric ores. Firms including Krupp in Essen, Thyssen in Duisburg, and Hoesch in Dortmund grew into major industrial corporations with workforces of tens of thousands. The Krupp steelworks became the largest industrial employer in Germany and a symbol of German industrial power.

The Ruhr's development created one of the most rapid urbanizations in European history. Cities including Essen, Dortmund, Bochum, Gelsenkirchen, and Duisburg expanded from small towns to industrial metropolises within a generation. The population of the region grew from approximately 237,000 in 1843 to over 1.5 million by 1895 and 3.5 million by 1914, driven by migration from eastern Prussia, Westphalia, and later from Poland and southern Europe.
