Manchester is a city in northwest England, historically part of the county of Lancashire. During the [[First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840)]] and well into the 19th century, it served as the global center of cotton textile production and became the archetypal industrial city, concentrating within its boundaries the social contradictions, technological transformations, and political conflicts of industrialization in their most acute form.

Manchester's rise as an industrial center was driven by its proximity to the Lancashire coalfields, its access to the River Irwell and a network of canals (the Bridgewater Canal, opened in 1761, was the first major industrial canal in Britain), and its established merchant networks in the textile trade. As the mechanized cotton mills multiplied from the 1780s onward, the city's population expanded at an extraordinary rate, from approximately 25,000 in 1772 to over 300,000 by 1850. This rapid urbanization produced chronic overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, polluted water, and recurring epidemic disease. Cholera outbreaks struck the city in 1832 and 1849. Friedrich Engels, who worked in his family's Manchester cotton firm in the 1840s, described the living conditions of the city's working class in *The Condition of the Working Class in England* (1845), documenting slum housing, child labor, and industrial disease.

Manchester was also the center of the political movements generated by industrialization. The Peterloo Massacre of 1819, in which cavalry charged a crowd of approximately 60,000 people gathered at St. Peter's Field to demand parliamentary reform, became a defining moment in British labor and democratic history. The city was a hub of the Chartist movement in the 1830s and 1840s. The Manchester School of political economy, associated with Richard Cobden and John Bright, advocated free trade and the repeal of the Corn Laws, successfully achieved in 1846.

By the mid-19th century, Manchester was known internationally as "Cottonopolis." The opening of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 extended the city's industrial reach into the 20th century.
