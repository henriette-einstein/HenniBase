London lies in the southeastern corner of England, straddling the [[River Thames]] roughly 50 kilometres inland from its estuary. At 51° north latitude it sits further north than most of Canada's major cities, yet the [[Gulf Stream]] keeps its climate mild and damp throughout the year. The Thames shaped everything — its tidal reach made the site accessible to ocean-going vessels while its freshwater upstream allowed settlement, and the river remains the city's defining geographic spine.

The Romans founded Londinium around 43 CE on the north bank of the Thames, selecting a gravel terrace just wide enough for a bridge. Within a generation it had become the largest city in the province of [[Britannia]], a busy trading hub linked by road to every corner of the island. Boudicca, queen of the [[Iceni]], burned it to the ground around 60 CE — archaeologists still find a thin layer of red ash beneath the modern City — but it was rebuilt and soon surpassed all rivals. Roman walls enclosed roughly 330 acres, fragments of which survive today in the basement of a Barbican office block and beside a pub near the old gate at Aldgate.

After the Roman withdrawal in the early fifth century the city contracted and fell into partial ruin. [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlers established a new market town, Lundenwic, slightly to the west around modern Covent Garden, but [[Alfred the Great]] deliberately moved habitation back inside the old Roman walls in the 880s as a defence against [[Viking]] raids. The Norman Conquest of 1066 brought the [[Tower of London]] — begun by [[William the Conqueror]] as a statement of dominance — and a rapid shift toward the city's medieval form. London struck a deal with each new dynasty: in exchange for taxes and loyalty it obtained charters protecting its commercial freedoms, a pragmatic relationship that gave the City of London the peculiar semi-autonomous status it retains to this day.

Medieval London grew dense and fetid along the Thames waterfront, its economy driven by wool exports and the import of Flemish cloth, wine from Gascony, and spices routed through [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]]. The [[Black Death]] killed perhaps half its population in 1348, yet within a generation the city had filled again. The [[Tudor]] period brought explosive growth: printing presses clustered near St Paul's, joint-stock companies began to form, and the first purpose-built theatres appeared in Southwark, just across the river outside the city's jurisdiction. [[William Shakespeare]] wrote for the [[Globe Theatre]] there in the 1590s and early 1600s.

The seventeenth century was catastrophic and transformative in equal measure. The [[Great Plague]] of 1665 killed around 100,000 people, and a year later the [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed 13,200 houses and 87 churches across the medieval city. [[Christopher Wren]] led the rebuilding, designing 51 new churches and the current [[St Paul's Cathedral]], which was completed in 1710 and dominated the skyline for two and a half centuries. The destruction paradoxically accelerated London's modernisation by forcing the replacement of timber-framed buildings with brick.

Through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries London became the capital of a global empire and the largest city on Earth. The [[Port of London]] handled goods from every continent. The [[Bank of England]], founded in 1694, anchored an international financial system. The [[Industrial Revolution]] drew hundreds of thousands of migrants from Ireland, rural England, and later Eastern Europe and the Caribbean. The [[London Underground]], opened in 1863 as the world's first metropolitan railway, knitted the expanding suburbs together. By 1900 the city held over six million people.

The [[Second World War]] left deep marks. The [[Blitz]] of 1940 to 1941 destroyed or damaged roughly a third of the City of London and killed more than 30,000 civilians. Postwar reconstruction was often hasty and uninspired, producing tower blocks that still punctuate the south London skyline. Yet the city recovered its energy rapidly. The 1948 [[Olympic Games]] were held here while rationing was still in effect. Waves of immigration from the former empire in the 1950s and 1960s — particularly from [[Jamaica]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]] — transformed the city's culture, cuisine, and music in lasting ways.

Today London is home to roughly nine million people and functions simultaneously as the political capital of the [[United Kingdom]], one of the world's two or three leading financial centres, and a node of global culture whose museums, universities, theatre scene, and music industry draw talent from every continent. Its 33 boroughs form an administrative patchwork governed by the Mayor of London alongside the anachronistic but fiercely independent City of London Corporation, which administers the original square mile. The Thames continues to flow through it all, still tidal, still the reason the city exists where it does.
