The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland occupies most of the British Isles off the northwestern coast of continental Europe. It comprises four constituent countries — [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]] — each with its own distinct culture, legal tradition, and in some cases devolved legislature. The island of Great Britain, which holds the first three, is separated from France by the [[English Channel]] at its narrowest point of just 34 kilometres. Northern Ireland shares a land border with the [[Republic of Ireland]] to the south, a fact that has shaped its politics profoundly.

The constitutional form is a parliamentary monarchy. The reigning monarch is head of state but exercises little direct political power: executive authority rests with the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who govern as long as they hold the confidence of the elected House of Commons. The uncodified constitution is assembled from statute, convention, and common law accumulated over centuries, making the UK unusual among modern democracies for having no single constitutional document.

The territory's political union was assembled in stages. [[England]] and [[Wales]] were legally joined under the [[Laws in Wales Acts]] of 1535 and 1542. The [[Acts of Union 1707]] merged the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain, driven partly by shared Protestant succession concerns and partly by English economic leverage following Scotland's ruinous [[Darien Scheme]]. A further [[Act of Union 1800]] brought Ireland into a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], though the southern 26 counties left to form the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, leaving the current configuration.

From the seventeenth century onward the country assembled the [[British Empire]], which at its peak around 1920 covered roughly a quarter of the Earth's land surface and governed approximately 500 million people. The empire was built on naval supremacy, chartered trading companies such as the [[East India Company]], and a willingness to use overwhelming force. It carried English law, the English language, and Protestant Christianity to every continent, while extracting raw materials and markets that fuelled domestic prosperity. It also inflicted violence, famine, and cultural destruction at vast scale — the [[Bengal Famine of 1943]], the suppression of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], and the plantation of Ulster are among the most consequential episodes.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] began here in the mid-eighteenth century, transforming the [[Midlands]] and northern England through mechanised textile production, steam power, and coal mining. Cities like [[Manchester]], [[Leeds]], and [[Birmingham]] grew from market towns to industrial metropolises within two generations. The country exported not only manufactured goods but the organisational and technological templates of industrialisation to the rest of the world.

The twentieth century was one of enormous sacrifice and gradual retrenchment. The [[First World War]] killed roughly 700,000 British soldiers and ended the long Victorian confidence in inevitable progress. The [[Second World War]] exhausted national finances and accelerated the dissolution of empire, which unfolded largely between 1947 and 1980 through a mix of negotiated independence and armed insurgency. Postwar reconstruction brought the [[National Health Service]] into existence in 1948, one of the most significant acts of domestic legislation in the country's history, providing universal healthcare free at the point of use. Large-scale immigration from the Caribbean, South Asia, and later East Africa reshaped the social fabric of British cities through the second half of the century.

The United Kingdom joined what became the [[European Union]] in 1973 and left it on 31 January 2020 following the [[Brexit]] referendum of 2016, in which 52 percent voted to leave. The referendum exposed and deepened fractures along lines of age, education, region, and national identity. [[Scotland]], which voted 62 percent to remain, has seen renewed momentum for independence. Northern Ireland's relationship with both the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the UK was partially reshaped by the [[Northern Ireland Protocol]] and subsequent [[Windsor Framework]] negotiated to manage the unique position of the land border. The long-term constitutional and economic consequences of leaving the EU remain contested.
