Richard Arkwright was an English inventor and entrepreneur born in Preston, Lancashire, on 23 December 1732. Often called the "Father of the Industrial Factory System," he is credited with pioneering both the mechanical spinning of cotton and the organizational model of the modern industrial factory.

Born into a poor family, Arkwright worked initially as a barber and wig-maker before turning his inventive attention to textile production. In 1769, he patented the water frame, a spinning machine driven by water power that produced stronger thread than the competing spinning jenny. Unlike the jenny, which remained suitable for household use, the water frame required a dedicated water-powered facility, making centralized factory production a structural necessity.

In 1771, Arkwright opened the world's first water-powered cotton mill at Cromford in Derbyshire. It employed approximately 200 workers organized in two 12-hour shifts, constituting one of the earliest examples of the factory system of labor: workers employed for wages at fixed hours in a centralized, purpose-built production facility. Arkwright also built housing for migrant workers near the mill, establishing an early model of industrial paternalism.

His patents were contested and overturned in court in 1785 on the grounds that his designs were not fully original, but his business ventures proved resilient. He was knighted in 1786. At his death on 3 August 1792, he left an estate valued at over £500,000, making him one of the wealthiest self-made men in Britain.
