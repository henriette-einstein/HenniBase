George Stephenson was an English engineer and inventor born near Newcastle upon Tyne on 9 June 1781. Known as the "Father of the Railways," he was the principal figure in the development of steam-powered rail transport, transforming it from a colliery curiosity into a nationally significant mode of transportation.

Stephenson grew up in poverty and had no formal education, learning to read as an adult. He began working in coal mines as a boy, driving horses and eventually becoming an engineman. His practical experience with machinery gave him an intimate understanding of steam power. In 1814, at age 33, he combined existing tramway and steam engine technology to build his first steam locomotive, the Blucher, which hauled coal from Killingworth Colliery.

In 1821, Stephenson was appointed chief engineer for the Stockton and Darlington Railway. When it opened in 1825, it became the first public railway in the world to use steam locomotives for both freight and passenger service. He subsequently designed the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830 as the first fully steam-operated intercity passenger railway.

Together with his son Robert Stephenson, he designed the Rocket, which won the Rainhill Trials of 1829 and demonstrated conclusively that steam locomotives were faster, more reliable, and more economical than horse-drawn transport. The Rocket's design became the template for steam locomotive engineering for the following 150 years. Stephenson also established the standard rail gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches, which became the global standard and is still in use today. He died in Chesterfield, England, on 12 August 1848.
