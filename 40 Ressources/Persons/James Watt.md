James Watt was a Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer born in Greenock, Scotland, on 19 January 1736. He is best known for his transformative improvements to the steam engine, which made it a practical and efficient power source for industrial applications. His work is widely regarded as one of the central technological contributions to the [[First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840)]].

Watt trained as a mathematical instrument maker and opened a workshop at Glasgow University in 1757. In 1763, he was asked to repair a Newcomen engine belonging to the university. Observing that roughly three-quarters of the steam's thermal energy was lost because the single cylinder had to be alternately heated and cooled, Watt devised a solution: a separate condenser that allowed the cylinder to remain hot continuously. He patented this improvement in 1769.

Later, in collaboration with the entrepreneur Matthew Boulton, Watt developed a rotary steam engine capable of driving machinery rather than merely pumping water. This rotary motion was the key innovation that enabled steam power to spread across British industry, including textile mills, iron works, flour mills, distilleries, and canals. He also introduced the centrifugal governor for automatic speed control (1788) and a pressure gauge (1790), completing what became known as the Watt engine.

Watt introduced the concept of horsepower as a unit for comparing the output of steam engines to the work done by horses, a practical measure that facilitated commercial adoption. The SI unit of power, the watt, is named in his honor. He retired in 1800 and died in Handsworth, England, on 25 August 1819.
