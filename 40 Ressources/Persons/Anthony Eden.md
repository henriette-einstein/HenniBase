Robert Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon, was a British Conservative politician who served three separate terms as Foreign Secretary and as Prime Minister from April 1955 to January 1957. His career spanned four decades and encompassed the years of appeasement, the [[Second World War]], and the early [[Cold War]], yet his reputation came to be defined above all by the [[Suez Crisis (1956)]], which ended his premiership and reshaped Britain's position in the postwar international order.

Eden was born on 12 June 1897 at Windlestone Hall in County Durham into a landed gentry family. He was educated at Eton and served in the [[First World War]], during which he was awarded the Military Cross. Two of his brothers were killed in the war. He read Oriental Languages at Christ Church, Oxford, before entering Parliament as the Conservative member for Warwick and Leamington in 1923. His command of foreign languages, knowledge of the Middle East, and facility in diplomatic settings marked him early as suited for foreign affairs. He became Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office in 1931 and rose through a succession of roles to become Foreign Secretary for the first time in December 1935, aged 38.

## First Foreign Secretaryship and Resignation (1935–1938)

Eden's first period as Foreign Secretary was conducted against the deteriorating backdrop of [[Fascism|fascist]] expansion in Europe. He sought to maintain the authority of the [[League of Nations]] while managing relations with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany. His relationship with Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] became increasingly strained over the question of [[Appeasement]]. Chamberlain favoured direct diplomatic engagement with Mussolini without preconditions. Eden regarded such engagement as rewarding aggression and undermining Britain's international credibility. He resigned on 20 February 1938, the first senior British minister to break openly with the appeasement policy. The resignation established his standing as a politician of conscience on foreign affairs and placed him in close alignment with [[Winston Churchill]], who was similarly opposing appeasement from the backbenches.

## Second World War and Second Foreign Secretaryship (1940–1945)

When Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, he appointed Eden Secretary of State for War and then, in December 1940, Foreign Secretary for a second time. Eden played a central role in wartime diplomacy, including attendance at the [[Yalta Conference (1945)]] and at the negotiations that shaped the postwar settlement. He was widely regarded as Churchill's political heir and deputy, though the expectation of a relatively quick succession went unfulfilled as Churchill remained in office well into his eighties.

## Third Foreign Secretaryship and Premiership (1951–1957)

When the Conservatives returned to power in 1951, Eden became Foreign Secretary for a third time under Churchill. During this period he helped negotiate the end of the [[Korean War (1950-1953)]], brokered the [[Geneva Accords (1954)]] that ended the [[Indochina War]], and guided the creation of [[SEATO]]. In April 1955, Churchill finally resigned and Eden succeeded him as party leader and Prime Minister. He called and won a general election the following month with an increased majority.

Eden's experience lay overwhelmingly in foreign affairs and he left domestic and economic policy largely to others. His handling of foreign policy as Prime Minister was shaped by his longstanding tendency to view international adversaries through the template of the 1930s. When Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalised the [[Suez Canal]] in July 1956, Eden drew an explicit analogy with the appeasers' failure to confront Mussolini and Hitler, a comparison that led him to pursue military action despite substantial opposition within his cabinet, from the Commonwealth, and from Washington.

The secret [[Protocol of Sèvres (1956)]], concluded with France and Israel in October 1956, produced a plan in which Israel would attack Egypt, providing Britain and France with a pretext to intervene as ostensible peacekeepers. The operation that followed was halted within days by American financial pressure and Soviet threats. Eden misled Parliament about the existence of the prior collusion, a deception whose extent became publicly documented only in later decades. His health collapsed under the strain of the crisis and its political consequences. He resigned on 9 January 1957, was succeeded by [[Harold Macmillan]], and subsequently retired from the Commons after 33 years as a member.

## Later Life

Eden was created Earl of Avon in 1961. He spent his later years writing his three-volume memoirs, published between 1960 and 1965, in which he offered a partial defence of his conduct during Suez. He died at Alvediston Manor in Wiltshire on 14 January 1977.
