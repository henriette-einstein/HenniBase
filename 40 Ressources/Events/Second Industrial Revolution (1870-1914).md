The Second Industrial Revolution refers to a period of accelerated industrial development lasting from approximately 1870 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The concept was introduced by Patrick Geddes in 1910 and later theorized by economic historian David Landes in his 1972 work *The Unbound Prometheus*. Unlike the [[First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840)]], which was centered on Britain and driven by textiles, iron, and steam, the Second was characterized by the global spread of industrialization, by science-based industries, and by the rise of Germany and the United States as the dominant industrial powers.

The leading sectors of the Second Industrial Revolution were steel, electricity, and chemistry. The Bessemer process (1856) and the open-hearth process enabled mass production of steel, replacing iron in railways, bridges, buildings, and machinery. Germany adopted the open-hearth process from 1869 and rapidly developed its [[Ruhr Valley]] steelworks. By 1900, both Germany and the United States had surpassed Britain in steel output, and by the early 20th century the United States led world production by a substantial margin.

Electrification transformed both production and urban life. Thomas Edison's system of electrical distribution, Nikola Tesla's alternating current, and the invention of the electric motor enabled factory electrification and new forms of urban transport. The first electric tram line opened in Berlin in 1881, operated by Siemens. Electricity also enabled new communication technologies: the telegraph, the telephone, and eventually radio.

Germany's chemical industry achieved world dominance through the close integration of university research, industrial investment, and corporate scale. The three firms BASF, Bayer, and Hoechst, together with five smaller producers, manufactured approximately 90 percent of the world's synthetic dyestuffs by 1913 and sold about 80 percent of their output abroad. German chemical companies also expanded into pharmaceuticals, photographic chemicals, and agricultural chemicals, creating diversified industrial conglomerates that employed professional salaried management, an organizational model Alfred Chandler identified as the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises.

In Germany, the period coincided with the era of the German Empire (1871–1914). German industrial output grew sixfold between 1871 and 1914, and German exports quadrupled. The share of world industrial production held by Germany reached approximately 15 percent by 1914, slightly exceeding Britain's 14 percent, while the United States held 32 percent. The branding imperative "Made in Germany," introduced by Britain as a warning label for inferior foreign goods, had by this period become a mark of quality. The phase ended abruptly with the mobilization for World War I in August 1914.
