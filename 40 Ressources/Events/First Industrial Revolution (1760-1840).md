The First Industrial Revolution describes the period of profound economic and technological transformation that reshaped Britain between approximately 1760 and 1840, then gradually spread to Belgium, France, and the United States. It marked the transition from agrarian, craft-based economies to systems of mechanized production, fossil fuel energy, and wage labor organized within the factory system.

Britain was the exclusive site of origin due to a convergence of structural factors. Cheap coal and relatively expensive labor created strong incentives for labor-saving machinery. High agricultural productivity freed workers for industrial employment while ensuring food supply. A dense network of rivers, canals, and coastal ports reduced transport costs. Political stability, a legal framework protective of property rights and patents, and a tradition of practical engineering and entrepreneurship further enabled rapid industrialization.

The leading sector of the First Industrial Revolution was textile production. A sequence of inventions transformed spinning and weaving from cottage industries into mechanized factory operations: the spinning jenny (Hargreaves, 1764), the water frame ([[Richard Arkwright]], 1769), the spinning mule (Crompton, 1779), and the power loom (Cartwright, 1785). Arkwright's Cromford Mill (1771) established the organizational template of the industrial factory. The steam engine, significantly improved by [[James Watt]] beginning in 1769, spread across multiple industries and became the era's defining symbol, though its quantitative contribution to industrial growth came primarily in the later decades.

Iron production expanded alongside textiles, driven by Abraham Darby's coke-smelting process and later improvements in puddling and rolling. Railways emerged in the final phase of the First Industrial Revolution: [[George Stephenson]]'s Stockton and Darlington Railway (1825) and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (1830) demonstrated the viability of steam-powered public transport.

The social consequences were sweeping. Urban populations expanded dramatically: by 1851 more people in Britain lived in towns than in the countryside. Factory labor replaced domestic and artisan production, drawing men, women, and children into long working hours under dangerous conditions. Real wages rose slowly and unevenly, with improvement for the lower classes becoming measurable only from the 1830s onward. Disease spread in overcrowded, unsanitary industrial cities. The disruption of traditional community structures and the emergence of a propertyless industrial working class generated the social and political tensions that would define the following century.
