The Suez Crisis was a military and diplomatic confrontation precipitated by the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company by Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] on 26 July 1956. It resulted in a coordinated military intervention by [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]] against [[Egypt]], and ended in a political defeat for all three intervening powers under combined pressure from the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]].

## Background

The Suez Canal, completed in 1869, had been operated since its construction by the Suez Canal Company, in which British and French financial interests held controlling stakes. Britain had stationed troops in the Canal Zone since 1882 and relied on the waterway as the central artery connecting the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Egyptian sovereignty over the canal was a longstanding demand of [[Arab Nationalism]].

The immediate trigger was the withdrawal of American and British funding for the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] on 19 July 1956. Nasser had pursued a policy of non-alignment and sought arms from the Soviet bloc after Western powers declined to supply them, placing Egypt increasingly within the orbit of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Eisenhower's cancellation of dam funding was intended as a signal of displeasure at Egypt's diplomacy. Nasser responded one week later by announcing the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company at a mass rally in Alexandria, declaring that canal revenues would finance the dam's construction. Egyptian forces simultaneously seized control of the canal installations.

## Sequence of Events

Britain and France began planning military action immediately after the nationalisation. The United States counselled a diplomatic approach and made clear it would not support unilateral force. Negotiations through international conferences and the United Nations produced no resolution acceptable to London and Paris.

In October 1956 representatives of Britain, France, and Israel met secretly at Sèvres and concluded the [[Protocol of Sèvres (1956)]], a covert arrangement under which Israel would attack Egypt in Sinai, giving Britain and France a pretext to intervene as peacekeepers separating the combatants and occupying the canal zone.

On 29 October Israeli forces invaded the Sinai peninsula and advanced rapidly toward the canal, routing Egyptian units. Britain and France issued an ultimatum demanding both sides withdraw to positions ten miles from the canal. Egypt rejected it. On 5 and 6 November British and French paratroopers and amphibious forces landed at Port Said and Port Fuad, advancing southward along the canal.

The military operation was halted by political and financial pressure rather than by Egyptian military resistance. US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], furious that the attack had been launched without American foreknowledge and during the final days of a presidential election, forced a resolution through the UN General Assembly calling for a ceasefire. The Soviet Union issued statements threatening rocket strikes against London and Paris if the intervention did not stop. Simultaneously, a run on the pound sterling made continued operations unsustainable without American support for an IMF loan, which Washington withheld. A ceasefire came into effect at midnight on 6 to 7 November 1956, with Anglo-French forces having advanced only 40 kilometres down the canal.

A UN Emergency Force ([[UNEF]]) was deployed from 15 November to oversee withdrawal. British and French troops completed their evacuation on 22 December 1956. Israeli forces held the Sinai and the Gaza Strip until March 1957, withdrawing only after receiving assurances on freedom of navigation through the Gulf of Aqaba.

## Consequences

The crisis accelerated the decline of British and French standing as independent global powers. Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] resigned in January 1957, in poor health following the episode. France drew from the crisis the conclusion that European states could not rely on the United States and redirected energy into European integration, contributing to the signing of the Treaty of Rome in March 1957. Britain rebuilt its relationship with Washington but became more explicitly dependent on American approval for major foreign policy actions.

Nasser emerged from the crisis with considerably enhanced prestige across the Arab world, despite the Egyptian military's defeat in the field. The canal remained under Egyptian sovereignty and reopened to shipping in April 1957.

The crisis demonstrated the degree to which the post-1945 international order was governed by the two superpowers. It signalled to European colonial powers that they could no longer enforce their interests in the developing world without American backing, and contributed to the acceleration of [[Decolonisation]] across Africa and the Middle East. The [[UNEF]] deployment established a template for UN peacekeeping operations that would be used repeatedly in subsequent decades.
