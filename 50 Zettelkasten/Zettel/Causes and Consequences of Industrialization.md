Industrialization originated in Britain in the mid-18th century from a convergence of structural preconditions rather than from any single invention. The coexistence of cheap coal and relatively expensive labor created a powerful incentive to develop machinery that substituted fossil energy for human effort. High agricultural productivity freed labor from subsistence farming and ensured food supply for a growing urban workforce. Dense transport networks, including rivers, canals, and later railways, reduced the friction costs of moving raw materials and finished goods. A legal and institutional framework protective of property, patents, and commerce allowed entrepreneurs to capture returns on innovation. High literacy and numeracy rates, sustained by wages sufficient to fund education, accelerated the practical problem-solving from which key inventions emerged.

These conditions reinforced each other. Cheap coal made the [[Steam Engine]] economical. The steam engine made deeper mining possible, producing more coal. Railways moved coal cheaply to textile mills, which reduced the cost of cloth, which expanded markets, which required more production. The feedback loops of industrial capitalism, once established, proved self-sustaining.

The consequences of industrialization operated across several dimensions simultaneously. Economically, it produced sustained per-capita income growth for the first time in recorded history, though real wages for the British working class did not rise measurably until the 1830s, decades after industrialization began. The [[Factory System]] concentrated production in large enterprises, substituting capital for skilled artisan labor and creating a propertyless industrial proletariat. New sectors, steel, electricity, and chemistry, emerged in the [[Second Industrial Revolution (1870-1914)]] and distributed industrial capacity more broadly across Germany, the United States, France, and Japan.

Socially, industrialization drove urbanization at unprecedented speed, creating cities inadequately prepared for the numbers arriving in them. Epidemic disease, overcrowding, child labor, and industrial injury were its most visible immediate costs. The dissolution of the extended family and the separation of home from workplace reorganized the basic unit of social reproduction. From this disruption emerged the trade union movement, socialist political parties, and eventually the [[Social Question]] as the central preoccupation of 19th-century politics.

Environmentally, industrialization inaugurated the systematic combustion of fossil fuels on an industrial scale, establishing the carbon-intensive energy regime whose consequences extend into the present. Contemporary observers noted air and water pollution in industrial cities, but the cumulative climatic consequences were not recognized until the 20th century.

The causes of industrialization were specific and contingent: they explain why Britain industrialized first and why other nations followed different trajectories. The consequences were general: every subsequent society that industrialized underwent variants of the same transitions from agrarian to urban, from artisan to factory labor, and from subsistence to wage-based consumption.
