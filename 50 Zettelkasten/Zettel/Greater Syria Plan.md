The repeated failure of the Greater Syria Plan illustrates a structural feature of postwar Middle Eastern politics: every external power with interests in the region calculated that a unified Arab state would be harder to manage than fragmented ones, and acted to prevent it. King [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] spent the 1940s lobbying for a Hashemite-led union of [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Transjordan]], and [[Palestine]] under his crown. Britain neither endorsed nor firmly rejected the plan, using it as quiet leverage over both Abdullah and the French while maintaining just enough ambiguity to prevent any outcome it had not authorised. France regarded any Hashemite expansion toward Syria as a direct threat to its mandate and blocked it unconditionally. The Arab League, dominated by Egypt and Saudi Arabia, opposed a Hashemite Greater Syria as dynastic imperialism dressed in nationalist language.

What makes this pattern significant is that the obstacles were not primarily ideological. Popular sentiment in Syria was not hostile to some form of unity. The obstacles were structural: the plan required the simultaneous consent of Britain, France, the Arab League, and the Palestinian population, and each actor had a different veto. The [[Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916)]] had not merely drawn borders. It had created a system in which the fragmentation of the Levant was self-reinforcing, because each fragment's patron had an interest in keeping it separate.

The Greater Syria Plan should be read less as a failed political project and more as a diagnostic: it reveals which actors held real veto power over the region's political geography in the decade after 1945.
