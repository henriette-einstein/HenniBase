*Lords of the Desert: Britain's Struggle with America to Dominate the Middle East* (2018) is a work of archival history by [[Barr, James]], a visiting fellow at King's College London and author of the related *A Line in the Sand* (2011). Drawing on declassified British and American government records, the book traces the covert and overt Anglo-American competition for supremacy in the Middle East from the end of the [[Second World War]] through the mid-1960s.

## Summary

The book's organising argument is that the [[United States]] did not merely stand aside as British power in the Middle East eroded, but actively worked to replace it. Barr traces this campaign across three interlocking arenas: oil, the Palestine question, and the politics of [[Arab Nationalism]]. American officials, motivated by a combination of anti-colonial ideology, commercial interest in Arab oil concessions, and Cold War calculations about the appeal of Soviet communism to nationalist movements, concluded that continued British imperial dominance was strategically counterproductive. This view hardened into policy, and Barr documents the mechanisms through which Washington undermined London's position.

The opening chapters cover the wartime and immediate postwar period, in which British influence in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and the Gulf still rested on treaties, bases, and client relationships built up over decades. The Anglo-American dispute over [[Palestine]] is treated at length: Britain's attempt to limit Jewish immigration while retaining Arab goodwill collided with American domestic politics and the Truman administration's support for a Jewish state, and the eventual withdrawal from the [[British Mandate for Palestine (1920-1948)]] left both the regional order and the Anglo-American relationship damaged.

The central section covers the [[Iranian Oil Nationalisation Crisis (1951-1953)]] and the [[Egyptian Revolution (1952)]]. The Anglo-Iranian crisis, in which Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] nationalised the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], exposed a fundamental divergence: Britain sought to restore control over Iranian oil, while the United States feared that heavy-handed intervention would drive Iran toward the Soviet Union. The CIA and MI6 eventually cooperated in the [[1953 Iranian Coup]], but the episode confirmed American willingness to prioritise its own Cold War calculus over British imperial interests.

The [[Suez Crisis (1956)]] occupies the book's climax. Barr reconstructs the sequence from [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s nationalisation of the Suez Canal through the [[Protocol of Sèvres (1956)]] conspiracy to the ceasefire forced by American financial pressure. His account emphasises that President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s intervention was not simply a reflexive reaction to the invasion but the culmination of a sustained American effort to replace Britain as the region's external guarantor. The forced withdrawal of [[Anthony Eden]] and his subsequent resignation are presented as the moment at which the transfer of regional primacy became irreversible.

## Main Theses

Barr advances three interconnected arguments. First, American behaviour in the region was not passive or merely reactive but constituted a deliberate strategy of displacement. Second, British officials were aware of this competition but were constrained from resisting it by economic dependence on American goodwill and dollar reserves, a vulnerability that became decisive at Suez. Third, the episode illustrates a broader dynamic in which the ostensibly shared values of the Anglo-American relationship masked genuine conflicts of interest that the stronger party was willing to exploit.

## Relevance

The book provides detailed archival grounding for several themes that appear elsewhere in the vault: the mechanics of the [[Suez Crisis (1956)]], the limits of British postwar power illustrated through [[Anthony Eden]]'s career, and the broader argument made in rentier state literature and [[Cold War]] scholarship about the relationship between oil, nationalism, and superpower competition. Barr's previous work *A Line in the Sand* covers the Anglo-French rivalry that created the modern Middle Eastern state system in the earlier part of the twentieth century and functions as a direct predecessor to this volume.
